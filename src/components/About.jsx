                I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford University advised by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://theory.stanford.edu/people/jcm/home.html">Prof. John Mitchell</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://stanford.edu/~cpiech/bio/index.html">Prof. Chris Piech</a>.
                I am interested in using technology to increase access to high quality STEM education, with the goal of making engineering more ethical and diverse.

                Before coming to Stanford, 
                I completed a M.S. in Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara supported by the HRL Laboratories Fellowship, where I worked on an operating system for running microservices in the IoT, advised by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~rich/">Prof. Rich Wolski</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~ckrintz/">Prof. Chandra Krintz</a>.
                I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Washington, where I investigated various properties of tournament design advised by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~karlin/">Prof. Anna Karlin</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://weberrobbie.com/">Prof. Robbie Weber</a>.

                Outside of research, I love hanging out with my friends and family, especially my baby niece and nephews :)
